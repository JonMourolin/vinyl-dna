## Ideas

### OG vs Repress
Show percentage of original pressings vs represses in collection. Help collectors understand the "authenticity" of their collection.

### Price Tracker
Track estimated value of collection using Discogs marketplace data.

### Collection Timeline
Visualize when releases were added to collection over time.

### Label Deep Dive
Detailed analysis of favorite labels: release count, genres, decades, rarity.

### Format Breakdown
Pie chart of formats: LP, 2xLP, 7", 12", box sets, etc.

### Listening Stats Integration
Connect with Last.fm or Spotify to show which records get played most.

### Collection Health
Identify duplicates, missing albums from artists you collect, incomplete discographies.

### Export Features
Export collection DNA as PDF report, CSV data, or JSON.
